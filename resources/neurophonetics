  abstract = {Abstract Many studies have used a neuroscience-based approach towards
	examination of writing and reading skills and how these might differ
	between languages. However, few studies have focused on differences
	in grammatical processing that may be specific to certain languages.
	Studies have shown that grammar for active and passive sentences
	differs between Chinese and English. Chinese, a morphologically non-inflectional
	language, is visibly different from inflectional languages in terms
	of verb morphology changes but similar in terms of subject and object
	transformation movements. We used a blocked design functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine brain activations during
	processing of three types of Chinese sentences: active sentences,
	passive sentences, and general declarative sentences in native Chinese
	speakers. We found similar brain activations for picture-active,
	picture-passive, and declarative sentences. However, differences
	in neural activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
	posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) were observed between active
	and passive conditions. Since the Chinese language does not require
	inflection of verbs when switching from active to passive sentences,
	it is possible that subject and object inversion led to the syntactic
	processing observed in the present study. These results provide evidence
	suggesting that different strategies are used for Chinese as compared
	to English for grammatical passive sentence inversions. },

	that might be related to phoneme representation in the brain and
	to discriminate EEG responses for each speech sound on a trial basis.
	<i>Approach</i>. We used multivariate empirical mode decomposition
	(MEMD) and common spatial pattern for feature extraction. We chose
	three vowel stimuli, /a/, /i/ and /u/, based on previous findings,
	such that the brain can detect change in formant frequency (F2) of
	vowels. EEG activity was recorded from seven native Korean speakers
	at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. We applied MEMD over
	EEG channels to extract speech-related brain signal sources, and
	looked for the intrinsic mode functions which were dominant in the
	alpha bands. After the MEMD procedure, we applied the common spatial
	pattern algorithm for enhancing the classification performance, and
	used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classifier. <i>Main
	results</i>. The brain responses to the three vowels could be classified
	as one of the learned phonemes on a single-trial basis with our approach.
	<i>Significance.</i> The results of our study show that brain responses
	to vowels can be classified for single trials using MEMD and LDA.
	This approach may not only become a useful tool for the brain&#8211;computer
	interface but it could also be used for discriminating the neural
	correlates of categorical speech perception.},

  abstract = {Abstract The dissociability of nouns and verbs and of their morphosyntactic
	operations has been firmly established by lesion data. However, the
	hypothesis that they are processed by distinct neural substrates
	is inconsistently supported by neuroimaging studies. We tackled this
	issue in a silent reading experiment during MEG. Participants silently
	read noun/verb homonyms in minimal syntactic context: article-noun
	(NPs), pronoun-verb (VPs) (e.g., il ballo/i balli, the dance/the
	dances; io ballo/tu balli, I dance/you dance). Homonyms allow to
	rule out prelexical or postlexical nuisance factorsâ€”they are orthographically
	and phonologically identical, but serve different grammatical functions
	depending on context. Under these experimental conditions, different
	activity to nouns and verbs can be confidently attributed to representational/processing
	distinctions. At the sensor level, three components of event-related
	magnetic fields were observed for the function word and four for
	the content word, but Global Field Power (GFP) analysis only showed
	differences between \{VPs\} and \{NPs\} at several but very short
	time windows. By contrast, source level analysis based on Minimum
	Norm Estimates (MNE) yielded significantly greater activity for \{VPs\}
	in left frontal areas and in a left frontoparietal network at late
	time windows (380â€“397 and 393â€“409&#xa0;ms). These results are
	fully consistent with lesion data, and show that verbs and nouns
	are processed differently in the brain. Frontal and parietal activation
	to verbs might correspond to morphosyntactic processes and to working
	memory recruitment (or thematic role assignment), respectively. Findings
	are consistent with the view that nouns and verbs and their morphosyntactic
	operations involve at least partially distinct neural substrates.
	However, they do not entirely rule out that nouns and verbs are processed
	in a shared neural substrate, and that differences result from greater
	complexity of verbal morphosyntax. },

  abstract = {<p>White matter (WM) mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging
	techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community.
	Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
	WM fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed
	to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function,
	influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of
	network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed
	connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury
	(TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history
	of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas
	P. Gage, in whom a â€œtamping ironâ€? was accidentally shot through
	his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The
	specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have
	not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography
	(CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical
	MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed
	male subjects (aged 25â€“36), we computationally simulate the passage
	of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed
	skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter
	(GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable
	damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact
	on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and
	other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor
	to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes.
	Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage
	to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected
	from that of a similarly sized â€œaverageâ€? brain lesion. These
	results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced
	by this noteworthy patient.</p>},
