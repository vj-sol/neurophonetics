	We assessed the effects of different priming frequencies of repetitive

	of rTMS (theta burst stimulation [TBS]), on temporoparietal language
	areas (i.e., Wernicke's area) localized with functional magnetic
	resonance imaging. Functional maps were acquired during an auditory
	word-detection task with native or foreign language sentences in
	14 healthy men. Frameless stereotaxy was used to guide the transcranial
	magnetic stimulation coil position over Wernicke's area. Active and
	placebo randomized sessions of priming stimulations (1 Hz rTMS or
	TBS) were applied at rest, and response times (RTs) were recorded
	during the auditory word-detection task performed subsequently with
	1 Hz rTMS. Individual anatomofunctional maps localized activation
	in Wernicke's area. Repeated-measure analysis of variance for RTs
	revealed that priming with 1 Hz rTMS facilitated the detection of
	native words, whereas priming with TBS facilitated the detection
	of foreign words. Consistent with motor cortex studies, these findings
	suggest that priming frequency plays a crucial role in word detection

	into structurally and functionally distinct areas. Anatomical subdivision
	of Broca's area has been achieved using different microanatomical
	criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and distribution of neuroreceptors.
	However, brain function also strongly depends upon anatomical connectivity,
	which therefore forms a sensible criterion for the functio-anatomical
	segregation of cortical areas. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
	(MR) imaging offers the opportunity to apply this criterion in the
	individual living subject. Probabilistic tractographic methods provide
	excellent means to extract the connectivity signatures from diffusion-weighting
	MR data sets. The correlations among these signatures may then be
	used by an automatic clustering method to identify cortical regions
	with mutually distinct and internally coherent connectivity. We made
	use of this principle to parcellate Broca's area. As it turned out,
	3 subregions are discernible that were identified as putative Brodmann
	area (BA) 44, BA45, and the deep frontal operculum. These results
	are discussed in the light of previous evidence from other methods

	by any other method in vivo. For the first time, there is a possibility

	examination of writing and reading skills and how these might differ
	between languages. However, few studies have focused on differences
	in grammatical processing that may be specific to certain languages.
	Studies have shown that grammar for active and passive sentences
	differs between Chinese and English. Chinese, a morphologically non-inflectional
	language, is visibly different from inflectional languages in terms
	of verb morphology changes but similar in terms of subject and object
	transformation movements. We used a blocked design functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine brain activations during
	processing of three types of Chinese sentences: active sentences,
	passive sentences, and general declarative sentences in native Chinese
	speakers. We found similar brain activations for picture-active,
	picture-passive, and declarative sentences. However, differences
	in neural activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
	posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) were observed between active
	and passive conditions. Since the Chinese language does not require
	inflection of verbs when switching from active to passive sentences,
	it is possible that subject and object inversion led to the syntactic
	processing observed in the present study. These results provide evidence
	suggesting that different strategies are used for Chinese as compared
	to English for grammatical passive sentence inversions. },

	phase of low-frequency (delta, theta) and the amplitude of high-frequency
	(gamma) oscillations in the auditory cortex. Phase entrainment is
	stronger in the right and amplitude entrainment is stronger in the
	left auditory cortex. Furthermore, edges in the speech envelope phase
	reset auditory cortex oscillations thereby enhancing their entrainment
	to speech. This mechanism adapts to the changing physical features
	of the speech envelope and enables efficient, stimulus-specific speech
	sampling. Finally, we show that within the auditory cortex, coupling
	between delta, theta, and gamma oscillations increases following
	speech edges. Importantly, all couplings (i.e., brain-speech and
	also within the cortex) attenuate for backward-presented speech,
	suggesting top-down control. We conclude that segmentation and coding
	of speech relies on a nested hierarchy of entrained cortical oscillations.},

  abstract = {Despite intensive work on language-brain relations, and a fairly impressive
	accumulation of knowledge over the last several decades, there has
	been little progress in developing large-scale models of the functional
	anatomy of language that integrate neuropsychological, neuroimaging,
	and psycholinguistic data. Drawing on relatively recent developments
	in the cortical organization of vision, and on data from a variety
	of sources, we propose a new framework for understanding aspects
	of the functional anatomy of language which moves towards remedying
	this situation. The framework posits that early cortical stages of
	speech perception involve auditory fields in the superior temporal
	gyrus bilaterally (although asymmetrically). This cortical processing
	system then diverges into two broad processing streams, a ventral
	stream, which is involved in mapping sound onto meaning, and a dorsal
	stream, which is involved in mapping sound onto articulatory-based
	representations. The ventral stream projects ventro-laterally toward
	inferior posterior temporal cortex (posterior middle temporal gyrus)
	which serves as an interface between sound-based representations
	of speech in the superior temporal gyrus (again bilaterally) and
	widely distributed conceptual representations. The dorsal stream
	projects dorso-posteriorly involving a region in the posterior Sylvian
	fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary (area Spt), and ultimately
	projecting to frontal regions. This network provides a mechanism
	for the development and maintenance of "parity" between auditory
	and motor representations of speech. Although the proposed dorsal
	stream represents a very tight connection between processes involved
	in speech perception and speech production, it does not appear to
	be a critical component of the speech perception process under normal
	(ecologically natural) listening conditions, that is, when speech
	input is mapped onto a conceptual representation. We also propose
	some degree of bi-directionality in both the dorsal and ventral pathways.
	We discuss some recent empirical tests of this framework that utilize
	a range of methods. We also show how damage to different components
	of this framework can account for the major symptom clusters of the
	fluent aphasias, and discuss some recent evidence concerning how
	sentence-level processing might be integrated into the framework.},

	Nine left- and 11 right-lateralized hubs were identified as peaks

	The left-lateralized hubs included regions from the default mode

	rule out prelexical or postlexical nuisance factors—they are orthographically

	activity to nouns and verbs can be confidently attributed to representational/processing
	distinctions. At the sensor level, three components of event-related
	magnetic fields were observed for the function word and four for
	the content word, but Global Field Power (GFP) analysis only showed
	differences between \{VPs\} and \{NPs\} at several but very short

	fully consistent with lesion data, and show that verbs and nouns
	are processed differently in the brain. Frontal and parietal activation
	to verbs might correspond to morphosyntactic processes and to working
	memory recruitment (or thematic role assignment), respectively. Findings
	are consistent with the view that nouns and verbs and their morphosyntactic

	connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury
	(TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history
	of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas
	P. Gage, in whom a “tamping iron��? was accidentally shot through
	his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The
	specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have
	not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography
	(CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical
	MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed
	male subjects (aged 25–36), we computationally simulate the passage
	of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed
	skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter
	(GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable
	damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact
	on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and
	other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor
	to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes.
	Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage
	to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected
	from that of a similarly sized “average��? brain lesion. These
	results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced
	by this noteworthy patient.</p>},

  abstract = {We examine the evidence that speech and musical sounds exploit different
	acoustic cues: speech is highly dependent on rapidly changing broadband
	sounds, whereas tonal patterns tend to be slower, although small
	and precise changes in frequency are important. We argue that the
	auditory cortices in the two hemispheres are relatively specialized,
	such that temporal resolution is better in left auditory cortical
	areas and spectral resolution is better in right auditory cortical
	areas. We propose that cortical asymmetries might have developed
	as a general solution to the need to optimize processing of the acoustic
	environment in both temporal and frequency domains.},
