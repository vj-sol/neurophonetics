  abstract = {Over the years, a large body of work on the brain basis of language
	comprehension has accumulated, paving the way for the formulation
	of a comprehensive model. The model proposed here describes the functional
	neuroanatomy of the different processing steps from auditory perception
	to comprehension as located in different gray matter brain regions.
	It also specifies the information flow between these regions, taking
	into account white matter fiber tract connections. Bottom-up, input-driven
	processes proceeding from the auditory cortex to the anterior superior
	temporal cortex and from there to the prefrontal cortex, as well
	as top-down, controlled and predictive processes from the prefrontal
	cortex back to the temporal cortex are proposed to constitute the
	cortical language circuit. },

  abstract = {<i>Objective</i>. The objective of this study is to find components
	that might be related to phoneme representation in the brain and
	to discriminate EEG responses for each speech sound on a trial basis.
	<i>Approach</i>. We used multivariate empirical mode decomposition
	(MEMD) and common spatial pattern for feature extraction. We chose
	three vowel stimuli, /a/, /i/ and /u/, based on previous findings,
	such that the brain can detect change in formant frequency (F2) of
	vowels. EEG activity was recorded from seven native Korean speakers
	at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. We applied MEMD over
	EEG channels to extract speech-related brain signal sources, and
	looked for the intrinsic mode functions which were dominant in the
	alpha bands. After the MEMD procedure, we applied the common spatial
	pattern algorithm for enhancing the classification performance, and
	used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classifier. <i>Main
	results</i>. The brain responses to the three vowels could be classified
	as one of the learned phonemes on a single-trial basis with our approach.
	<i>Significance.</i> The results of our study show that brain responses
	to vowels can be classified for single trials using MEMD and LDA.
	This approach may not only become a useful tool for the brain&#8211;computer
	interface but it could also be used for discriminating the neural
	correlates of categorical speech perception.},

	approach to evaluating physical and cognitive work, particularly
	in mobile settings. Neuroergonomics research employing mobile and
	immobile brain imaging techniques are discussed in the following
	areas of physical and cognitive work: (1) physical work parameters;
	(2) physical fatigue; (3) vigilance and mental fatigue; (4) training
	and neuroadaptive systems; and (5) assessment of concurrent physical
	and cognitive work. Finally, the integration of brain and body measurements
	in investigating workload and fatigue, in the context of mobile brain/body
	imaging (MoBI), is discussed.},

  abstract = {<p>White matter (WM) mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging
	techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community.
	Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
	WM fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed
	to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function,
	influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of
	network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed
	connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury
	(TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history
	of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas
	P. Gage, in whom a â€œtamping ironâ€? was accidentally shot through
	his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The
	specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have
	not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography
	(CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical
	MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed
	male subjects (aged 25â€“36), we computationally simulate the passage
	of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed
	skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter
	(GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable
	damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact
	on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and
	other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor
	to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes.
	Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage
	to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected
	from that of a similarly sized â€œaverageâ€? brain lesion. These
	results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced
	by this noteworthy patient.</p>},
